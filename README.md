# FIJI/ImageJ macros

Macros that I made for FIJI/ImageJ to elaborate or analyze images. It's not rocket science, just a way to save the workflow and keep track of some steps. (WIP)

## Instructions

These macros are intended for storing certain workflows. I don't usually spend much time on complete automation. The code is divided into steps. Select groups of code and press `Shift+Cmd+R` or Run > Run Selected Code.

> Shortcuts are usually for Mac orLinux. Check the corresponding one for your system.
