# FIJI/ImageJ macros

Macros for FIJI/ImageJ to process and analyze images. Not rocket science, just a way to keep track of workflows and automate repetitive tasks. (WIP)

## Installation

Copy the `.ijm` files to your FIJI macros folder (`Plugins > Macros > Install...`) or simply open by drag-and drop for one-time usage.

## Usage

These macros are designed to be run step-by-step rather than fully automated:

1. Open a macro in FIJI's macro editor

2. Select the code block you want to run

3. Press `Shift+Cmd+R` or use `Run > Run Selected Code`

Main info and instructions are included as comments inside the code of each file.

> **Note:** Shortcuts shown are for Mac or Linux. Check the corresponding ones for your system.
